# Python project management with uv

The objective of this practice is to learn how to manage a Python project.
We are going to use the following tools:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the Python management tool
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
